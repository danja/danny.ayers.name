    <h1>Dogalog</h1>
<p>An educational toy - learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a> while making beats! <a href="https://danja.github.io/dogalog/">Live on the Web</a>! (<a href="https://github.com/danja/dogalog">source</a>)</p>
<p>I stumbled on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_rhythm">Euclidean Rhythms</a> a little while ago, an arithmetic pattern for spacing beats in a bar, found across all kinds of music. It&#39;s kinda like a constraint problem.</p>
<p>More recently I had another look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding">livecoding</a> music. I seem to have something of a mental block on it, I still haven&#39;t really had a go. Although intrigued I did write a <a href="https://github.com/danja/sp-mc">MCP server</a> for <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic Pi</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the other night I couldn&#39;t sleep. Those ideas clunked together in my head, making me think about livecoding in Prolog. I spent most of the night roughing something out with Codex. I still haven&#39;t looked if there&#39;s already a Prolog livecoding engine - I&#39;m probably reinventing the wheel. Well, this will be training wheels.</p>
<p>Because the following day I realised I couldn&#39;t remember how Prolog works. So the challenge became to make something that would get me livecoding <em>and</em> teach me Prolog.
<a href="https://danja.github.io/dogalog/">Dogalog</a> is the result of a good few hours with Claude on it. It&#39;s reasonably well structured, should be ok to extend/maintain. Probably a mistake implementing the Prolog engine from scratch. But without the fancier constructs and optimisations, it isn&#39;t that complicated: term definitions, parser, unifier. The in-place editing went a lot more smoothly than I could have imagined.</p>
<p>It would benefit from a few more eyeballs. I wonder if anyone still teaches Prolog?
I guess I&#39;ll post to Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/livecoding/">r/livecoding</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/prolog/">r/prolog</a>.
