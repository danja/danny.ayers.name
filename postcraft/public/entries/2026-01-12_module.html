    <h1>Birthday Module</h1>
<p>It&#39;s my birthday the day after tomorrow. My current thing is modular synthesis, so my present to myself has to be a new module. But modules typically cost €€€s and right now I need to economise, until I find some more work. However I have plans.</p>
<p>Oops! New PCBs arrived for Plan A so I ended up working on them and the software.</p>
<h2>Plan A</h2>
<p>A few months ago I got a little obsessed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_modelling_synthesis">physical modelling synthesis</a>. As a starting point I was curious about how one might get a realistic clarinet sound this way. I had a go in <a href="https://danja.github.io/flues/clarinet-synth/">software</a> with limited success. And I promptly slipped down the rabbithole of <a href="https://github.com/danja/flues">experimenting with synth code</a> (aided by AI assistants).</p>
<p>What I really wanted was this in hardware, in my modular rack. But looking around the available modules, none really fitted the bill (at a sane price). So I started looking how best to do it myself. I settled on having a go with a design I found online that uses a <a href="https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed">Daisy Seed</a>. It&#39;s a PCB module with a fast processor and quality audio rate ADCs/DACs built in.</p>
<h2>Plan B</h2>
<p>ESP32 module on stripboard - in progress</p>
<h2>Plan C</h2>
<p>Cheapo sequential switch module. <em>Arrived and added to rack.</em></p>
<p>I had the hardware for 2 modules for Plan A, and they worked! Now in rack. Actually made 3 sets of software, I need to buy some more components...
