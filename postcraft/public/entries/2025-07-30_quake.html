    <h1>Predicting Earthquakes with AI</h1>
<p>This is a problem I&#39;ve been intermittently looking at for a few years now. I&#39;m strongly convinced it is feasible to get useful notification ahead of dangerous seismic events...with some major caveats.</p>
<p>There is a lot of reliable, historic and real-time seismic data available. It&#39;s typically expressed as motion over time of points on the surface of the planet. It&#39;s possible to correlate between data from different monitoring locations to pinpoint with reasonable accuracy the source of particular sets of measurements, after the fact.  </p>
<p>AI tools have, in recent years, got very good at making predictions about the behaviour of physical systems over time. Synthetic videos can be generated that convincingly show apparent real-world events.</p>
<p>But <strong>the system in which earthquakes occur is massive, extremely complex and chaotic</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to be in condition to receive radio seismic precursors it takes very strong earthquakes and we must be very close to them</p>
