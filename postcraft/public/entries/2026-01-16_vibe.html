    <h1>Vibe Coding Synths</h1>
<p>Andrej Karpathy came up with the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding">Vibe Coding</a> to describe writing software by giving AI assistants control of the detail of the code, the programmer only works at the level of text description.</p>
<p>As a <strong>mediocre programmer</strong>, I find this appealing. (I do have decades of experience to offset the mediocrity).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent a lot of time over the past couple of years using AI assistants to help me with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">Semantic Web</a>/AI <a href="https://github.com/danja/tensegrity">projects</a>. This has been quite the learning experience... I haven&#39;t been fully vibe coding - I have gone hands-on with the code quite a lot. But I&#39;ve been using Node.js, which I&#39;m reasonably familiar with, and I&#39;m reasonably comfortable with the domain. Overall I&#39;ve found the approach very productive.</p>
<p>So I decided to see how far I could get with synth building, using a similar approach. I&#39;m fairly lousy with the necessary languages, but by adopting a mostly-vibe approach, I&#39;ve got  <strong>all the way</strong>. I&#39;ve made sound generators/processors in the following formats:</p>
<ol>
<li>In-browser Javascript</li>
<li>lv2 plugins (the Linux user&#39;s VSTs)</li>
<li>Native Linux - including Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>Embedded - targeting Daisy Seed (with an ESP32 design in-progress)</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s an ordered list for a reason. While the earlier items are (kinda) complete standalone projects, they&#39;ve also acted as prototypes for the designs later in the list.</p>
