<p>This is a test.</p>
<p>Rather wonderfully both Codex and Claude have a decent grip on how <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions">Transmissions</a>, my pipeliney thing, works.
I&#39;m not entirely sure what&#39;s being used under the hood, but I did get <strong>Claude</strong> to create a <strong>Skill</strong> for creating <em>Transmissions</em> (what I call my pipelines).
Claude was then able to build me a feed aggregator using Transmissions as the engine.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using Transmissions-based apps for publishing my blog content for a while now. The source content I write as markdown files in my local filesystem. One app pushes this content off to a remote SPARQL store (Fuseki on my server), another app renders the content as HTML, yet another creates the index pages.</p>
<p>This works ok but an outstanding issue was that each time I ran these apps, every single blog post was processed again. So I just got Codex to modify the pipelines to keep a note of changes. It chose to use a local JSON file for keeping the cache info, which is fine by me. Everything looks like it still functions ok. My tests are a bit haphazard, the best test is to run the thing. For which I need a new blog post. So,</p>
<p>This is a test.
