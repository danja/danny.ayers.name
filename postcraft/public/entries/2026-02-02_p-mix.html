    <h1>P-Mix</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danja/flues/tree/main/lv2/p-mix">P-Mix</a> is an lv2 plugin that acts kinda like an autonomous DJ. It fades/cuts tracks in a DAW in &amp; out.</p>
<p>Recently I&#39;ve had quite a good workflow going on in the music room. A lot of experimentation with modular etc, building up tunes. I&#39;ve got quite systematic about the process for mixing &amp; mastering. I&#39;ve stuck a few quasi-finished pieces on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Spike+%26+Wave+hyperdata">search query &quot;Spike &amp; Wave hyperdata&quot;</a>). But I&#39;ve got loads of material stuck at a certain point between the build up of layers and the final mix. Typically 8+ tracks, some of them loops, some of them changing over time. But all there in parallel, by default on all the time. Things need to come in and out.</p>
<p>What&#39;s really frustrating is that the stage after this, putting icing on things, an effect here and there, novel sample or whatever, is good fun. I just tend to get stuck at this just-beyond-loops phase. Doing this part of the mixing takes ages, and because you&#39;re going over the same material over &amp; over again it gets tiring and your judgement quickly goes downhill. Like it&#39;s pretty easy to decide on an intro, the first 20 seconds or so of a piece. Then it starts to become a chore and you lose engagement. Ok, I&#39;ve been attempting to get around this by breaking it up into short sessions, do a bit at a time. But still, the brain fog from repitition descends pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Then it occurred to me - automate it!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been doing loads of coding with Claude &amp; Codex AI assistants, including a bunch of (mostly unfinished) lv2 plugins. So I&#39;d got the infrastructure in place - ie. basically workinig example code which the AI can use for reference. Which is fortunate, seeing as I&#39;m really lousy at C/C++. It pleases me immensely that <strong>lv2</strong>s use Turtle syntax RDF (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semweb</a> ftw!).</p>
<p>Here I set a bunch of 8 or so parallel tracks in a loop with the plugin on each of them, and had a play with the modular while it did its thing : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tD_csaHqdQ">Live from the music room</a></p>

<p>P-Mix : a probabilistic mixer lv2</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danja/flues/tree/main/lv2/p-mix">P-Mix</a> is a very simple lv2 plugin that acts kinda like an autonomous DJ. It fades/cuts audio tracks in a DAW in &amp; out. For when you get stuck with a loop.</p>

<p>(There are a bunch of other toys in the <a href="https://github.com/danja/flues">repo</a>, various levels of unfinishedness)
