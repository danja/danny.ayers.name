    <h1>What I&#39;ll do when I get cancer</h1>
<p>Dramatic title, but legitimate. I estimate there&#39;s 1/3 probability cancer sees me off, 1/3 general decline because aging, 1/3 hit by a bus/asteroid. I still smoke, spent most of my life drinking at a risky level. So I can do a first-person view on this.</p>
<p>I&#39;m actually prompted because a friend&#39;s mother got a bad diagnosis. Wish I could help. I&#39;m a little embarrassed about how little I know the science around cancer. I lost my wife to a very aggressive leukemia. I think it was the aggressive chemo that did for her, but I do believe the medics were doing their best.</p>
<p>What do I know? Well for starters, despite the cultural norm on it, it&#39;s not a death sentence. My dad got bladder cancer 4? decades ago. Had radiotherapy, left him with a tangerine for fluid storage, but he&#39;s still happily plodding through his 90s.</p>
<p>What do I know? Well quality of life is the overarching principal. Health issues are monsters at sapping the will to live. One day at a time, sweet Jesus H. Yeah, that&#39;s a thing - religion can mitigate the deathiness. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary for making the best of things. One of the physicists&#39; models of the universe (&quot;block&quot;?) has reality as a smear over space-time. Also, like butterfy wings, a person&#39;s existence modifies the universe. Caroline has persistence.</p>
<p>Sod Dignitas. I have a serious phobia there - suicide, and nearby capital punishment. I&#39;m blubbing up now, cannot think on such things. Bit ironic given that I repeatedly have the ideation, very prone. Actually got ropes hanging from the ceiling in most of my rooms, for fun stuff. <strong>Loads of sharp things</strong> and toxins. But just no.
Point there, IMHO, if you&#39;re thinking Dignitas, you are missing the point. And being a drama queen.  </p>
<p>The only good suicide : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT_rlpOSqg4">Cheree</a></p>
<p>I have very strong reservations about the power of positive thought in fixing physical problems. But there&#39;s no argument against the converse, if you have negative thoughts all the time, you have a shit life. Very likely to cause physical problems.</p>
<p>What? Ok, practically. Cancer is cells that have slipped out of kilter, reproducing when they shouldn&#39;t be. So on an intuitive level I think this suggests that encouraging the norm is likely to be helpful.
 We have evolved to be creatures to survive in this bizarre environment. Got brains even. I don&#39;t know, it sounds nonsense as I type, but bear with me. We move around, gather food, are very sociable, procreate.</p>
<p> Oh yeah, first, that&#39;s a point. When I get my own bad cancer diagnosis, all kinds of crank ideas will be worth considering. It <em>might</em> be nonsense, but if there&#39;s a 0.001% chance of some Siberian tree snot being helpful, why not.</p>
<p> Nobel prize smartypants <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> got convinced Vit C was the cure for cancer. I remember throwing the notion to AaronSW and he threw it back, he said it speaks for itself - no supporting evidence, and prostate cancer got Pauling.</p>
<p> But I do suspect high dose Vit C might be useful. What I think is important is that the human body doesn&#39;t neatly categorise its subsystems. When I&#39;m crashing with my internal organs destroying themselves at a cellular level, I will be extremely vulnerable to external forces - viruses, bacteria, yeasts and the crew. Vit C is good for boosting immune system <em>before</em> infection, Vit D good for chasing off the infection after it&#39;s got you (I read a lot during Covid).</p>
<p> As far as I can gather, an awful lot of the human system relies on gut bacteria. To the pile of Vit C &amp; D, plus a multi I&#39;ll add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_boulardii">Saccharomyces boulardii</a> as a supplement worth taking. Lactic stuff is probably useful if you like cheese. Water kefir aka tibicos <em>(lovely word, like chisanbop)</em> is a bit pot luck, but I grow it, it has sorted bad guts for me more than once. Avoid heavily processed food, yadda yadda...</p>
<p> I&#39;m about to make myself blush. The feeling that doing the stuff that we were built to do, normalise the system : forage/hunt, socialise, procreate. The first is well-documented, physical exercise and creative thought is good for you. People are massive, community, friends - health issue, bring people closer.
 Ok, blush time : have sex, or more conveniently : masturbate a lot. Do you see now why I&#39;m narrating this cancer as my problem? Suggest to my friend to suggest to his mother that she masturbates a lot.
Laughing is medicine for aching wrists. I&#39;ll get my coat.
