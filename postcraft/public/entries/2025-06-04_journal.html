<p>So I <em>might</em> have fixed the path error I&#39;d made for myself. This is a test post to find out. I&#39;d better check image paths too. Here&#39;s Claudio having a walk -</p>
<p><img src=\"/images/2025-06/claudio-walk.jpeg\" alt=\"walking dog\"></p>
<p>Ok, a definite improvement. It has revealed another little issue. Escaping, that other bugbear. My pipelines need some escaping because representations of this content - markdown &amp; HTML - are going through SPARQL queries. Looks like I&#39;ve got a bit of it in the wrong place. While the image of Claudio resolves correctly in the <code>index.html</code> recent posts, that&#39;s not the case for the single-page renderings. The image link there looks like :</p>
<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;img src=\\&quot;/images/2025-06/claudio-walk.jpeg\\&quot; alt=\\&quot;walking dog\\&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Escaped quotes. Ops.</p>
<h2>Eye Reasoner</h2>
<p>That was pleasing. I&#39;ve been wanting to do something with a reasoner in #:transmissions for a while now but never really had practical justification. I just did it for fun. Took about 30 mins.</p>
<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye-js\">Eye Reasoner</a> is Euler Path-based, works with N3. The JS lib couldn&#39;t be easier in use. Here&#39;s the <code>Processor</code> (pipeline node) which contains it :</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the transmission (pipeline) :</p>
