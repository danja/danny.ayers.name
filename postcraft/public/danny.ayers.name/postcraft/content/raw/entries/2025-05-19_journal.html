<h2>Inversion of control</h2>
<p>For a change this afternoon the AI has given me directions.</p>
<p><img src=\"/images/2025-05/dickens.png\" alt=\"Robot instructs Dickension mill worker\"></p>
<p>My priority at the moment is getting #:semem organized, but to that end I need some extras in #:transmissions, and better SPARQL UI... So I&#39;ve been on a little cycle round the subprojects. Which today has led me to #:tbox, which is just a Docker setup with containers that will hopefully, eventually, run the projects in a unified, consistent, portable fashion.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not very good with Docker, hate this kind of admin. After a bit of discussion with Claude I decided I need CI/CD on my thing. GitHub workflows are relatively new to me - and it&#39;s more of the same kind of admin. So I asked Claude how I should tidy up #:tbox and also how to do testing/CI. Two artifacts, 3 pages each, which I&#39;ve printed. This afternoon I&#39;ll just work through them. At least until I get distracted by the need to do one of the real-world chores I&#39;ve been procrastinating over. Faced with a more boring task, cleaning the kitchen seems a lot more manageable.
