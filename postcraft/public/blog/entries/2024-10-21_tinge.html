        <h1>Tinge</h1>
<p>&#39;Tinge&#39; was the solution to the clue &#39;Hint&#39; in today&#39;s Guardian Quick Crossword, the one I got a little stuck on - shoddy clue, imho.</p>
<p>I completed it in 8 minutes - a personal best, I believe. I think I got it down to 10 when I was doing it pretty much every day in Buxton, in the pub after work. Now I only try every few week.</p>
<p>This was after getting Wordle in 3 really quickly.</p>
<p>I have slight mania. Known, controlled, environmental cause. I was up all night coding, only got an hour or so&#39;s sleep before the alarm went off (at 9:57). I actually felt reasonably rested, soon got on with things. I have drifted off on tangents 3 or 4 times, but no worries, flights of fancies are fine, I was very aware being a bit fugueish.</p>
<p>Drifting a bit now.</p>
<p>So. Couple of hour&#39;s job: get all my #:postcraft instances processed and bunged where they should be. Locally first, but it&#39;ll be the same structure on the server.</p>
<p>I&#39;m struggling to focus on this - the #:tbox container thing is calling me. After spending a lot of time getting #:t to load (ES) modules from arbitrary location, I really want to stick all this code in a SPARQL store. The assumption that source code should exist in files on a filesystem is very deeply wired into anyone born after maybe 1940. It&#39;s only a bloody persistence mechanism. I want my code up there in the Giant Global Graph.</p>
<p>Loads of security hazards, mostly because it&#39;s not the usual way of doing things, fs stuff has been pentested to buggery.</p>
<p>Where was I?</p>
<h2>Postcraft Instances Go Go!</h2>
<p>I reckon I need a root <code>manifest.ttl</code> (in <code>server/deploy</code>) that has a list of includes to pick up and run the individual instances.</p>
<p>Where&#39;s that ns?</p>
<p>Oh dear. I was thinking separation of concerns but this is something like the bastard child of premature disoptimisation and NAGNI.</p>

<p>From now on, stick everything under :</p>
<pre><code class="language-turtle">@prefix tns: &amp;lt;http://purl.org/stuff/transmissions/&amp;gt; .
</code></pre>
<p>Flip that lot ^ later.</p>
<p>What does this root manifest need to say?</p>
<p>&gt; A set of relative URLs that contain the <code>manifest.ttl</code>s of each of the #:postcraft instances.</p>
<p>#:todo I should get #:vb VocBench running soon.</p>
<p>#:todo Grr. Need to modify all the Turtle.</p>
<p>Ok, I&#39;ve got things like :</p>
<pre><code class="language-turtle">@prefix trm: &amp;lt;http://purl.org/stuff/transmission/&amp;gt; .

:clean a trm:Pipeline ;
    rdfs:label &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; ;
    rdfs:comment &amp;quot;directory cleaner&amp;quot; ;
    trm:pipe (:r10 :r20 :r30 :r40 :r50 :r60) .
</code></pre>
<p>Each of those <code>transmissions.ttl</code> can hold multiple transmissions.</p>
<p>Ops. It&#39;s the <code>manifest.ttl</code> I&#39;m meant to be looking at.</p>
<p>Simplest thing that could possibly work?</p>
<p>JSON guff.</p>
<p>Hmm. I want those files to be treated as named graphs, but also try and avoid flipping to nquads just yet if I can help it.</p>
<p>REview -</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd ~/github-danny/transmissions
 ./trans postcraft ../server/docs/postcraft
</code></pre>
<p> So I guess the child manifests should have an association with the application that uses them.</p>
<p> I can&#39;t be bothered diving into local fs vs. global URLs right now, just give them a path.</p>
<p> The manifests as they stand are instancy, many share the same <strong>application</strong>, just different details.</p>
<p> How have I been doing fs paths in them so far!?</p>
<p>Crudely.</p>
<pre><code class="language-turtle">t:CSS a pc:StaticGroup ;
    pc:site &amp;lt;https://danny.ayers.name&amp;gt; ;
    fs:sourceDirectory &amp;quot;layouts/mediocre/css&amp;quot; ;
    fs:targetDirectory &amp;quot;public/home/css&amp;quot; .
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is when SKOS is called for. But for now, simplest thing....</p>
<p>Naming. Saigon, shit.</p>
<p><code>realm</code> would probably be more accurate, but that&#39;s so overloaded. Go with <code>space</code></p>
<p>Prefix <code>tran</code> looks ok.</p>

<p>Ok, that might be enough of a starter. But better try it first with the new spaces-</p>

<p>Heh, I&#39;d got a note-to-self in there mentioning SIOC. I bet that has some of these things.</p>
<p>So the runner will be something like :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd ~/github-danny/transmissions
./trans ../server/deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Ok,that works. But how do I get at the Dataset?</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">| Running :  (SM) p10 a DatasetReader
DatasetReader, datasetName = dataset
DatasetReader, message[datasetName] =
</code></pre>
<p>Enough on that.</p>
<p>Next job was to check how far I&#39;d got with #:fam</p>
<p>Wait, do the repopacks in case I feel inspired in bed on the phone in the morning</p>
