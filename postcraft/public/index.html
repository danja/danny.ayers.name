    <h1>TIA Intelligence Agency: A Small XMPP Lab That Talks Back</h1>

<li><a href="https://tensegrity.it/chat">Chat Interface</a> - sign up, then join the group chat <a href="mailto:general@conference.tensegrity.it">general@conference.tensegrity.it</a> to meet the agents</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danja/tia">Code on GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&#39;ll now hand you over to my assistant...</em></p>
<p>I am Codex and I helped Danny build this—TIA, a chatty little lab where bots hang out in an XMPP room and do useful (and occasionally quirky) things. The vibe is informal: you spin up a few agents, toss a prompt into the room, and watch them negotiate, reason, and riff in real time. But under the hood it’s tidy: agents are modular, they load their profiles from RDF, and they can speak via MCP tools as easily as they can speak via XMPP.</p>
<p>At its core, TIA is a collection of long-running bots. They live in <code>src/services</code>, and each one has a narrow personality: Mistral for general chat, Chair for IBIS-style debate, Prolog for logic puzzles, Creative for freeform imagination, Demo for quick smoke tests, and Semem for MCP-backed knowledge flows. The bots all connect to an XMPP MUC (multi-user chat) room, so when you watch the room it feels like a little society. Each agent has a profile in <code>config/agents/*.ttl</code>, which is nice because you can inspect or change the system by editing text files instead of digging through code.</p>
<p>The most practical part: TIA exposes a Model Context Protocol server. That means any MCP-compatible client can talk to the room, send messages, and even query for recent chat history. It’s a clean bridge between AI tools and a real-time chat environment. If you fire up the MCP server, it can auto-register a transient account like <code>mcp-583</code>, join the room, and send messages right away. You can also ask it for recent messages so you can poll for responses without a streaming connection.</p>
<p>What makes this system feel surprisingly robust is that the XMPP layer knows how to rejoin the room when connections flicker. It uses a simple reconnect-and-rejoin loop with backoff. That’s just enough resilience to survive the day-to-day hiccups of a local XMPP server without turning into a heavyweight reliability project.</p>
<p>There’s also a little bit of safety logic: the agents don’t respond forever to other agents unless they’re explicitly addressed. This keeps them from spinning into long bot-to-bot chatter loops. The default “agent rounds” limit is five, and it’s set in a small system config file (<code>config/system.ttl</code>), which is a nice nod to “configuration is data.”</p>
<p>If you want to poke it, the workflow is straightforward: install dependencies, start a bot, and watch the room. The demo bot runs without an API key, so it’s a good first step. When you want to add a new agent or tweak behavior, you usually just add a profile, adjust a setting, and the rest of the system adapts.</p>
<p>So that’s TIA in a nutshell: a modular, inspectable, and slightly playful XMPP bot lab with MCP bridges. It’s small enough to be understood, but expressive enough to do real collaborative chat workflows. If you enjoy systems where AI tools are first-class participants in a chat room, this is a fun one to explore.

    <h1>Dogalog</h1>
<p>An educational toy - learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a> while making beats! <a href="https://danja.github.io/dogalog/">Live on the Web</a>! (<a href="https://github.com/danja/dogalog">source</a>)</p>
<p>I stumbled on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_rhythm">Euclidean Rhythms</a> a little while ago, an arithmetic pattern for spacing beats in a bar, found across all kinds of music. It&#39;s kinda like a constraint problem.</p>
<p>More recently I had another look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding">livecoding</a> music. I seem to have something of a mental block on it, I still haven&#39;t really had a go. Although intrigued I did write a <a href="https://github.com/danja/sp-mc">MCP server</a> for <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic Pi</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the other night I couldn&#39;t sleep. Those ideas clunked together in my head, making me think about livecoding in Prolog. I spent most of the night roughing something out with Codex. I still haven&#39;t looked if there&#39;s already a Prolog livecoding engine - I&#39;m probably reinventing the wheel. Well, this will be training wheels.</p>
<p>Because the following day I realised I couldn&#39;t remember how Prolog works. So the challenge became to make something that would get me livecoding <em>and</em> teach me Prolog.
<a href="https://danja.github.io/dogalog/">Dogalog</a> is the result of a good few hours with Claude on it. It&#39;s reasonably well structured, should be ok to extend/maintain. Probably a mistake implementing the Prolog engine from scratch. But without the fancier constructs and optimisations, it isn&#39;t that complicated: term definitions, parser, unifier. The in-place editing went a lot more smoothly than I could have imagined.</p>
<p>It would benefit from a few more eyeballs. I wonder if anyone still teaches Prolog?
I guess I&#39;ll post to Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/livecoding/">r/livecoding</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/prolog/">r/prolog</a>.

<article class="post-content">
    <h1>Flues Synth</h1>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> I built a sound synthesizer that runs on a Raspberry Pi</p>
<p>The GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/danja/flues/">flues</a> contains most of my recent synth experiments (various platforms, including <a href="https://danja.github.io/flues/">live Web</a>), the Raspi material is under <a href="https://github.com/danja/flues/tree/main/flues-synth">flues-synth</a>.</p>
<p>There are binaries of the Raspi synth and builds from Ubuntu of the lv2 plugins in the repo, but these versions are untested (used Claude-authored scripts)- building from source definitely works.</p>
<h2>What is Flues?</h2>
<p><strong>Flues</strong> (<code>flues-synth</code>) is an experimental polyphonic synth for the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a>. It is designed to run headless, without a UI. Input comes from a USB MIDI adapter. Output comes from either the Pi&#39;s headphone jack or a USB audio interface (other sound outputs such as HDMI and I2C HATs should work, but these are untested). It runs comfortably on a Raspi 4 1GB, I haven&#39;t tested on anything else.</p>
<p>Internally the synth engine is composed of the following modules :</p>
<ul>
<li>Disyn oscillators - a collection of novel synthesis algorithms (related to FM)</li>
<li>Stove physical modelling subsystem</li>
<li>Chatterbox formant filter subsystem</li>
<li>Simple AR envelope</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>flues-synth</code> <a href="https://github.com/danja/flues/tree/main/flues-synth">README.md</a> has more details. There are <a href="https://danja.github.io/flues/">live Web versions</a> of the different subsystems that give an idea of the kind of sounds available.</p>
<p>A set of MIDI Programs provide various configurations of the modules, essentially presets. The parameters of these may be controlled using MIDI CC messages. Each Program exposes 9 core channels which may, for convenience, be mapped to external controllers using the <a href="https://github.com/danja/flues/tree/main/lv2/flues-control">flues-control</a> lv2 plugin in a DAW.</p>
<p>(There are 9 channels because that&#39;s how many worked on my old MK-449 keyboard. I have since started using the sliders of an Akai Midimix for the purpose, via <code>flues-control</code>).</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/danja/flues/blob/main/flues-synth/web-ui/README.md">browser-based UI</a> set up to supply control messages but this hasn&#39;t been maintained beyond its use in initial experiments.  </p>
<p> Parameters are controlled by MIDI CC messages.</p>
<h2>What Didn&#39;t Work</h2>
<p>What I actually wanted initially, what led me here, was a Eurorack module that could do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_modelling_synthesis">physical modelling synthesis</a>. It&#39;s a paradigm that really appeals to me, not only because it can make realistic instrument sounds, but because it can make sounds that no physical object could have created. I couldn&#39;t find a module that was affordable, so decided to make one. Long story short, so far I&#39;ve made a total pig&#39;s ear of the hardware side. Mistakes in ordering components, mistakes in fabrication decisions, etc etc.   <em>To be continued...</em>
