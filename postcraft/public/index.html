<h1>Code Insiders</h1>
<h2>VSCode Insiders</h2>
<p>I just remembered seeing there&#39;s <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/">VSCode Insiders</a>, a daily build. Pleasing is :
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Insiders installs next to the Stable build, allowing you to use either independently.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<p>Hmm. <strong>apt upgrade</strong> saw a newer kernel for me, but is segfaulting on something to do with the NVIDIA drivers. I&#39;ve only got a really rubbish old GPU in this machine. I&#39;m also still on Ubuntu 24.04, need to upgrade soon.</p>
<p>Yay, it didn&#39;t segfault on a second run. Lets see what happens on reboot...<strong>no problem</strong>, good-o.</p>
<p>Running <code>code-insiders</code> brings it up. Yes, independent of the stable instance. Ok, this is nice. I can use Copilot of this one, other AI bits on the other.</p>
<p>btw I&#39;m using <a href="https://pulsar-edit.dev/">pulsar-edit</a> (formerly Atom) for these docs. Similar tool, different theme, different purpose.</p>

<h1>Journal 2025-03-26</h1>
<p><strong>Yay!</strong></p>
<p>I spent much of the last couple of weeks paying off technical debt. A blocker was my doc management setup #:postcraft, an application of #:transmissions. On the surface (and my immediate need is), the world&#39;s most over-engineered static site builder for my blog.</p>
<p>The last 5 yards was really frustrating. But now I have the trickiest parts good-enough for now, the transmissions being (source on GitHub) :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions/tree/main/src/applications/md-to-sparqlstore">md-to-sparqlstore</a> - walks local dirs, pushes markdown docs (with metadata) to a SPARQL store</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions/tree/main/src/applications/sparqlstore-to-html">sparqlstore-to-html</a> - pulls docs from SPARQL store and renders as HTML pages</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions/tree/main/src/applications/sparqlstore-to-site-indexes">sparqlstore-to-site-indexes</a> - this renders a <code>index.html</code> and a <code>atom.xml</code> for the most recent entries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The site-specific configuration for all of these is contained in a <a href="https://github.com/danja/strandz.it/blob/main/postcraft/manifest.ttl">manifest.ttl</a> (this one currently only being used for testing).</p>
<p>All this is provisional, there&#39;s a lot of tweaking to do in the #:postcraft application, loads of refactoring needed in #:transmissions along with masses of minor bugfixes and small feature additions. But I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m just about ready to publish a 0.9.0 version of #:transmissions as an npm, #:postcraft very soon as a release.</p>
<p>Get my blog publishing again first. This needs the static site support stuff - CSS etc - copying in place. Right now the above works by processing <em>everything</em>, but I know how to make it more sensible. Easiest way I can tell it is working is by cleaning up first.
I believe I&#39;ve got all the necessary to do this more-or-less in place, I just need to create the transmission.</p>
<p>So I&#39;ve copied <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions/tree/main/src/applications/example-application">example-application</a> and renamed to <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions/tree/main/src/applications/postcraft-statics">postcraft-statics</a>.</p>
<p>It needs to :</p>
<ol>
<li>delete current site material - maybe not all at once, so I can be more selective if need be</li>
<li>copy layouts across</li>
<li>publish to host</li>
</ol>
<p>I think I will leave 3. for now. I have been using GitHub as a transfer mechanism - push from my desktop, pull from the server.</p>
<p>For 1. I have <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions/blob/main/src/processors/fs/FileRemove.js">src/processors/fs/FileRemove.js</a>. On a skim that looks current with the engine now (comments/docs need doing - later).
For 2. <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions/blob/main/src/processors/fs/FileCopy.js">src/processors/fs/FileCopy.js</a> grrr, that isn&#39;t up-to-date. But it looks easily fixable.</p>
<p>Oh, I also have to update the #:postcraft template dir layout to the latest conventions I&#39;m going for:</p>

<p><em>Rather bizarrely resuming things I was working on 20+ years ago, artifacts eg. <a href="https://hyperdata.it/stuff/ideagraph/">IdeaGraph</a> mindmappy knowledgebase thing from 2003, <a href="https://hyperdata.it/xmlns/rpp/2001/">RDF Process Profile</a>, vocab for expressing processes from 2001.</em>  </p>
<p>A lot of fragments, but there is an overall structure of sort. Naming is for <em>internal purposes</em>. All this in GitHub somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Current status overall</strong> is basically &quot;<em>many tools that will enable things in progress, slowly approaching usability</em>&quot; - ie. <strong>bootstrapping</strong>.</p>
<p>Virtually all code is <strong>node or vanilla JS</strong>.</p>
<p>In order of need-to-know.</p>
<ul>
<li>tbox - container</li>
<li>tia - XMPP agent templates (and vocab)</li>
<li>linguine - RDF vocab for inter-agent comms</li>
<li>clients - API connectors</li>
<li>transmissions - pipeliney thing</li>
<li>postcraft - doc management thing</li>
<li>semem - semantic memory using various interfaces (SPARQL knowledgebase, vector store, LLM API connectors)</li>
<li>zpt - <em>Zoom, Pan, Tilt</em> : RDF vocab for knowledgebase navigation</li>
<li>farelo - getting things done</li>
<li>squirt - user UI</li>
<li>hyperdata-desktop - dev UI</li>
<li>um - unnamed mythodology</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/danja/tbox">tbox</a></h2>
<p>A Docker setup (based on Alpine Linux, has ssh) to provide a <del>sandpit</del> integrated ecosystem for playing with this stuff. Main components not of my making are <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody</a> XMPP server, <a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/">Fuseki</a> SPARQL store.</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong> : Mostly set up, I need to cycle through again soon. Fuseki&#39;s working well enough for me to use it from other things, Prosody needs a bit more config. I think I&#39;ve got the environment to the point where it&#39;ll pull my bits from github and run - once they&#39;re working well enough. It needs something for auth, so far I&#39;ve only got hacky name/pass.</p>
<h2>tia Intelligence Agency</h2>
<p><em>I did think of a more usable name the other day, forgotten now...</em></p>
<p>This will basically be just a bunch of boilerplate &amp; templates for XMPP agents, making hook into the stuff below avaiable. Aim is to make it easy enough to code up an agent that an agent can do it.</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong> : I had a play around last year, enough to see what was needed client-wise, got a first-pass running (<a href="https://github.com/danja/dogbot">dogbot</a>).</p>
<h2>Transmissions</h2>
<p><em>I should probably do a video demo, there&#39;s a lot in here</em></p>
<p>This is the pipeliney thing that&#39;s been eating most of my time. I started because there were a bunch of things I wanted to make that followed this kind of app-shape. Recurring serendipity has kept me going.</p>
<p>At minimum, pipelines pass along JSON objects as messages (I&#39;ve also including an RDF dataset in that object here and there). Under the hood they&#39;re event-driven, run forward. I&#39;ve got some flow control &amp; concurrency, but I&#39;ve only been building that out as &amp; when needed.</p>
<p>The pipelines are defined in RDF Turtle, in a <code>transmissions.ttl</code> file, <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions/blob/main/src/applications/_pending/claude-json-converter/transmissions.ttl">example here</a> for breaking a Claudio data dump into dirs/files of text (so I could find things again).</p>
<p>Individual processors, eg. <code>:FileReader</code> follow an ultra-simple interface, essentially :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">messageOut = process(messageIn)
</code></pre>
<p>The processors are intended to be little operations, like <code>:FileReader</code> reads a file and adds its contents to the <code>message</code> to be passed on.</p>
<p>The details of how a processor behaves, its <em>config settings</em> can come from 3 sources in reverse order of precedence/increasing specificity :</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>config.ttl</code> in the same dir as <code>transmissions.ttl</code> - this is like default/global settings, eg. with the the <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions/blob/main/src/applications/_pending/claude-json-converter/config.ttl">Claude example</a></li>
<li>a <code>manifest.ttl</code> that exists in a <code>target</code> (this will soon support HTTP URLs, so far only fs, see <strong>Postcraft</strong> below)   </li>
<li>a <code>{ &amp;quot;key&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;value&amp;quot;}</code> pair in the message it receives to process</li>
</ul>
<p>One key bit of the <strong>serendipity</strong> I mentioned is that having all the pipeliney bits happening <strong>automagically</strong>, intended to make things easy for <em>me</em>, also happens to make things easier</p>
<h2>Postcraft</h2>
<p>This is the canonical example of a Transmissions application.</p>
<h2>ns</h2>
<h3>lingue</h3>
<h3>zpt</h3>
<ul>
<li>#:Zoom for the level of detail/abstraction</li>
<li>#:Pan for scope, domain</li>
<li>#:Tilt for the mix of layers (<em>a more literal analogy would be optical filters, but tilt lives with the two other terms which I&#39;m redefining</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>#:lingue = Lingue Franche, inter-agent messaging language</p>
<h3>um</h3>
<p><em>New vocabs...</em></p>
