# Mindset

*To **Get Things Done** I have to trick myself to change mindset.*

I wasted a lot of time in the last couple of weeks through not having decent tests in place. Easy explanation : it's a lot more fun developing new stuff than ensuring existing stuff works correctly. My subconscious says these are just my toys, I don't have to waste time on taking them seriously. But this is really counter-productive. I end up wasting time hunting down stupid mistakes and/or sorting out things I've just let ride until a time it's much harder to figure out. I wouldn't do this if I was working on code for someone else.

**Aim for releases.**
