# Mr. Brown

(as posted to FB)

At desk coding, YouTube reggae compilation on in the background. Music that has enough drive to keep me going, few surprises to distract.

Totally distracted by this.

Bob Marley's near-enough "Louie Louie", called "Mr.Brown" [1]

I've a feeling I know it very well, but very past life (The flip side  "Dracula" is same tune instrumental, likely been dubbed a lot).
Produced by Lee Perry. I would not have guessed. /s

It's close to "Hang on Sloopy" [2] melodically, but philosophically not a little "Cheree" [3].
(Time I did another version myself... I did do a straight, appropriately bad cover of "Louie Louie" [4] 9 years ago, but my "Vicar John" from around then is more interesting, and now I really want to do "Roller Girl" [5] while I've still got birthday henna in my hair...Have I ever actually recorded a version of "Wild Thing"..?).

The lyrics to Mr. Brown are suitably out-there, copy & paste version I found :

[[
[Verse 1]
(Who is Mr. Brown?)
Mr. Brown is a clown
Who rides through town in a coffin
(Where can he be found?)
In the coffin where there is three crows on top
And two is laughing

[Verse 2]
Oh, what a confusion, ooh, yeah, yeah
What a botheration, ooh, now, now
Who is Mr. Brown? I wanna know now
He is nowhere to be found

[Chorus]
From Mandeville to Sligoville
Coffin runnin' around
Upsetting, upsetting, upsetting the town
Asking for Mr. Brown
From Mandeville to Sligoville
Coffin runnin' around
Upsetting, upsetting, upsetting the town
Asking for Mr. Brown

[Verse 3]
I wanna know who (Is Mr. Brown?)
Is Mr. Brown controlled by remote?

Oh, calling duppy conqueror
I'm the ghost catcher
This is your chance
Oh, big, big Bill bull-bucka
Take your chance
Prove yourself, oh yeah

[Verse 4]
Down in parade
People running like a masquerade
The police make a raid
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, think it fade

[Verse 5]
What a thing in town
Crows, chauffeur-driven around
Skanking as if they had never known
The man they call Mr. Brown
I can tell you where he's from now

[Outro]
From Mandeville to Sligoville
Coffin runnin' around
Upsetting, upsetting, upsetting the town
Asking for Mr. Brown...
