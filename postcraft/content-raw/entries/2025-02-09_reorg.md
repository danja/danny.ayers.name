# Reorg

PS. I realised I needed easy access to the actual project repos from Pulsar for editing README.md etc, so I renamed the symlinks of the #:postcraft sections to eg. `semem-docs`. Also changed theme.  I like this combo.

I had started using git submodules to organise my code subprojects (of #:hyperdata, the umbrella). This turned out to be a bad idea. First, a bit of extra admin needed (and remembering these things were submodules) and then things started getting really confusing when I wanted to integrate the #:clients subproject into various other subprojects, one submodule into other submodules... Way too much #:CognitiveLoad.

So I'm simplifying :

```sh
danny@danny-desktop:~$ tree -L 1 hyperdata/

hyperdata/
├── clients
├── hyperdata
├── semem
├── tbox
└── transmissions
```

Each of those (and the rest) will be a completely independent repo/module. This change is fairly straightforward, the only bit that will need special attention is `hyperdata`, it needs to forget the submodules. I got the procedure for that from Perplexity, will do it once I'm sure everything's ok in the new structure.

A complication is that I've been using Pulsar Editor for docs. This is based on the old Atom editor, and works a treat for this purpose. I did start customizing it as `hyperdata-editor`, but I managed to break that, so reverted to the original source distro). It manages workspaces a little differently than VSCode and I've been using #:postcraft for docs, so to give me what I need in the editor a little bit of symlinking is needed. With this latest setup, so far I've done :

```sh
cd ~/hyperdata/hyperdata/workspaces/postcrafts

ln -s ~/hyperdata/hyperdata/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./hyperdata

ln -s ~/hyperdata/transmissions/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./transmissions
ln -s ~/hyperdata/clients/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./clients
ln -s ~/hyperdata/semem/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./semem
ln -s ~/hyperdata/tbox/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./tbox
...
```

Then I opened the first symlink as a folder in Pulsar, I'll add all the rest as folders to give me easy access to the lot.

I've also started reorganizing the bits that will be online :
```sh
danny@danny-desktop:~$ tree -L 2 sites

sites
├── danny.ayers.name
│   └── postcraft
├── hyperdata.it
└── strandz.it
```

They are currently all over the place. I'll fix that as I go along.

PS. Just realised I need to edit the README.md etc from here too, so I'll add :
```sh
ln -s ~/hyperdata/tbox ./tbox-repo

```
