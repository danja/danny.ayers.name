You should be able to talk to all apps, surely..?

For some interpretation of *talk*.

## The Joy of REPL

*Read-Eval-Print-Loop*

I do have a GUI in progress for #:transmissions, but that'll most just be an editor for now. Some of the things I've been trying recently are a bit of a pain just using the command-line directly :

That a bit of fun I was having with the [Eye reasoner](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye). It became clear I needed a bit more interactivity. Bring on the [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)!

That was playing with bits like this :

```sh
import clients from 'hyperdata-clients';

const client = createClient(provider, clientOptions)
const response = await client.chat([
            { role: 'user', content: message.content }
        ])
```
