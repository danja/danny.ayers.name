# Flues

I've put a couple of physical modelling synths online, have a play. The first was an attempt to emulate a clarinet. Second version "Stove" is more general. Both monophonic. You will have to experiment with the knobs to find anything remotely realistic. Stove supports MIDI in. Docs & code are nearby : https://danja.github.io/flues/
