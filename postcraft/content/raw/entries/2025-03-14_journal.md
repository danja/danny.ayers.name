**Pi Day!**

Ok, I hit an issue with nesting in #:transmissions. Can leave that for now.

Grrr. Might have to dive back into the core : the settings precedence doesn't seem quite right. It appears to be putting `config.ttl` above `manifest.ttl` rather than vice versa (if a manifest is given).

This is right at the limit of what I ccan remember (why I need #:semem). Ok, curiosity :
```sh
danny@danny-desktop:~/hyperdata/transmissions$ cloc --vcs=git --md .
```

Only a fraction of the files in the top 3 types are relevant, most is test data etc. But I think there's a lot of important Turtle classified as text.

I'm happy with the JS figures at this point in time. When *finished* (as much as it'll ever be), I reckon there should be about 50 'active' JS files, maybe 20 in the core (model, api, engine), 30 key processors. The same number of 'passive' - tests.
The ratio of JS file count and LOC isn't great IMHO. Average is about 50, I'd rather have that around the max (hmm, the Jasmine tests are long-winded, not a big deal, so maybe it's not as bad as it seems).

## Transmission nesting issue

#:todo move to #:transmissions docs

#:todo alsomake test for command-line named transmission calls

The `sparqlstore-to-site-indexes` #transmissions application should be a good place to use nested transmissions. I set them up, but didn't fully test. With :

```turtle
:sparqlstore-to-indexes a :Transmission ;
  :pipe (:p10 :p20 :p30 :p40 :p50) .
  ...
:p40 a :Accumulate ;
      :settings :accumulator .

:p50 a :make-html-index .

# HTML
:make-html-index a :Transmission ;
  :pipe (:p100 :SM2) .
  ...
```
It falls ove3r trying to make the processor connection,
```sh
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'receive')
    at Accumulate.<anonymous> (file:///home/danny/hyperdata/transmissions/src/model/Connector.js:28:33)
...
```

Somewhere around, in `Transmission.js` :

```javascript
getFirstNode() { // used for nested transmissions
  logger.log(this)
  logger.log(this.processors[0])
  return this.processors[0]
}
```
