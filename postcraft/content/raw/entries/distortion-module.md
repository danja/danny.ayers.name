# Distortion Module

I think I already posted this schematic :

Since then I soldered it up and made a front panel. It worked on the second attempt!

First time I'd labeled the power connector back-to-front. Which was annoying since I knew the red wire on Eurorack cables was perversely the negative. I must have doubled on it. Anyway, it fried the op-amp. Horrible to desolder.

 The front panel went well :

 **One Simple Trick!** - print onto glossy paper, laminate.

 End result was reasonably smart -

 I couldn't be bothered tweaking the layout further.

 The font is [Thrums Serif](https://www.cdnfonts.com/thrums-serif.font), btw. I designed it a few years back because I wanted to see how it was done, and wanted one that worked for me on web pages. I didn't really get it to look good on web pages, but serendipity - exactly what I want for front panels.
