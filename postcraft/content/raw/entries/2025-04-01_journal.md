I removed a load of submodules from hyperdata/packages, it was too confusing. But I forgot about this one. On trying to use it again I get :
2025-04-01 19:52:26.991 [warning] [Model][getRepositoryExact] Failed to get repository realpath for: "/home/danny/hyperdata/hyperdata/packages/danping.git". Error:Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, realpath '/home/danny/hyperdata/hyperdata/packages/danping.git'
This should be independent. How do I resolve?
