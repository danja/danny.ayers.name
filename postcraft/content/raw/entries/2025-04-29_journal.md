I broke #:transmissions!

Silly. The other day I moved some tests out of the way temporarily, forgot to put them back. Also got seriously mixed up with my naming of things.

Good prompt for a refactor.

## Terminology

### Transmission

### Settings

`transmissions.ttl`

Order of precedence, derived from :

* `transmissions.ttl`

### Application

* a runnable set of transmissions

### Target

* the datasource on which the application should be run
