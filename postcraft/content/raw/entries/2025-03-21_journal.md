Once again I'm having to cycle back in #:transmissions and fix/replace a hacky placeholder.

This time the `:Restructure` processor. It's acting on the config (from `config.ttl`) directly, rather than going up its `Processor` superclass which (more or less) has the precedence in place to look in `manifest.ttl` first. That I got working, `:Restructure` fails.

Really annoying, so time-consuming, things I'd forgotten about but I have to fix before moving forward.
