I have systemd autostart the tbox container on this computer but the image I've been using has known problems and I have to manually kill it and use docker-compose to start it again. However the fuseki site provides scripts itself, you can find in the jena-fuseki-docker-5.3.0 dir. So I think it makes sense to create a new image using that. But before starting, note the issues mentioned with the stain image discussed in TDBconcurrenterrorIssue#34stain_jena-docker.txt Can you please take a look and have a deep think about to replace the current fuseki setup with a clean, fault-free new version.

```sh
1. Stop all containers and remove lock files:
 cd /home/danny/hyperdata/tbox
 sudo systemctl stop tbox.service
 docker compose down
 sudo find ./data/fuseki -name "*.lock" -type f -delete
 sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) ./data/fuseki

 2. Rebuild and start the Fuseki container:
 cd /home/danny/hyperdata/tbox
 docker compose build fuseki
 sudo systemctl start tbox.service

 3. Check if the container is running properly:
 docker ps | grep fuseki
 docker logs $(docker ps -q -f name=tbox_fuseki)

 The key changes I've made to fix your Fuseki issues:

 1. Added proper lock file cleanup in the entrypoint.sh script
 2. Set the correct user permissions in docker-compose.override.yml
 3. Added the procps package in the Dockerfile
 4. Created a cleanup script to fix permissions and remove stale locks

 Try running these commands manually, and you should now have a working Fuseki setup that doesn't require manual
 intervention after restart.
```
