So I *might* have fixed the path error I'd made for myself. This is a test post to find out. I'd better check image paths too. Here's Claudio having a walk -

Ok, a definite improvement. It has revealed another little issue. Escaping, that other bugbear. My pipelines need some escaping because representations of this content - markdown & HTML - are going through SPARQL queries. Looks like I've got a bit of it in the wrong place. While the image of Claudio resolves correctly in the `index.html` recent posts, that's not the case for the single-page renderings. The image link there looks like :
```html
<img src=\"/images/2025-06/claudio-walk.jpeg\" alt=\"walking dog\">
```

Escaped quotes. Ops.

## Eye Reasoner

That was pleasing. I've been wanting to do something with a reasoner in #:transmissions for a while now but never really had practical justification. I just did it for fun. Took about 30 mins.

The [Eye Reasoner](https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye-js) is Euler Path-based, works with N3. The JS lib couldn't be easier in use. Here's the `Processor` (pipeline node) which contains it :

Here's the transmission (pipeline) :
