I broke #:transmissions!

## Web fs prompt

I would like you to write a node js HTTP server app called `WebStore` using ES modules and the express library that will do the following :

* handle HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, using a preset filesystem subdirectory on the server to store
* there will be HTTP Basic authentication on PUT, POST and DELETE with username:password
* content/media type will be handled using the standard technique through filename extensions
* run on port 4500

This will be put on an existing server running nginx, which will proxy to port 4500. Please create configuration `webstorage.conf`

Additionally I'd like a simple object-oriented command-line client app called `wstore` using yargs library in ES modules that supports the same core functionality as curl.

Base URL will correspond the server-side fs dir, so eg. `http://hyperdata.it/files` might correspond to `/home/hyperdata/webstore/files`. The filename with refer to both the local file and the target resource on the server.

Please render all source code as complete, individual artifacts.
