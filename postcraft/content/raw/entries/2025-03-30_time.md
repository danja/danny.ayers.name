# Time

*Clocks have changed, lost an hour. I've lost a few more myself without their help.*

Yesterday I wasted ages trying to fix a Dockerized Fuseki in my play container. Querying worked, but there was no admin page. I looked back at the Fuseki docs - the image doesn't include the admin page.

But I needed a query front end. I wanted one inside my #:squirt client eventually anyway, ok, today it is. This thing looked easy enough to set up. From the [yasguidocs ](https://docs.triply.cc/yasgui-api/) :

```
<head>
  <link href="https://unpkg.com/@triply/yasgui/build/yasgui.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@triply/yasgui/build/yasgui.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="yasgui"></div>
  <script>
    const yasgui = new Yasgui(document.getElementById("yasgui"));
  </script>
</body>
```

After about 3 hours using Claude Projects to integrate this into #:squirt, it finally worked. I looked at how Claude had figured it out. Essentially :

```javascript
  const container = document.getElementById('yasgui-container');
  if (container) {
    container.innerHTML = `
      <div class="yasgui-init">
        <button type="button" onclick="window.initializeYasguiComponent()" class="button-primary">
          Load SPARQL Query Editor
        </button>
      </div>
    `;
  }
```
All good.
