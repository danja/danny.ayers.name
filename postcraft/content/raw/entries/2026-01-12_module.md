# Birthday Module

It's my birthday the day after tomorrow. My current thing is modular synthesis, so my present to myself has to be a new module. But modules typically cost €€€s and right now I need to economise, until I find some more work. However I have plans.

Oops! New PCBs arrived for Plan A so I ended up working on them and the software.

## Plan A

A few months ago I got a little obsessed with [physical modelling synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_modelling_synthesis). As a starting point I was curious about how one might get a realistic clarinet sound this way. I had a go in [software](https://danja.github.io/flues/clarinet-synth/) with limited success. And I promptly slipped down the rabbithole of [experimenting with synth code](https://github.com/danja/flues) (aided by AI assistants).

What I really wanted was this in hardware, in my modular rack. But looking around the available modules, none really fitted the bill (at a sane price). So I started looking how best to do it myself. I settled on having a go with a design I found online that uses a [Daisy Seed](https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed). It's a PCB module with a fast processor and quality audio rate ADCs/DACs built in.

## Plan B

ESP32 module on stripboard - in progress

## Plan C

Cheapo sequential switch module. *Arrived and added to rack.*

I had the hardware for 2 modules for Plan A, and they worked! Now in rack. Actually made 3 sets of software, I need to buy some more components...
