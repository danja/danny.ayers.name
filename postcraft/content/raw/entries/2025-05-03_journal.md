Here’s the trace of where your message goes and how it should reach ProcessorImpl.getProperty:

CLI Entry:
You run:

This calls the bash script trans, which runs node [run.js](http://_vscodecontentref_/2) ....

Argument Parsing:
In run.js, yargs parses the --message argument and coerces it to a JS object.

CommandUtils:
CommandUtils.handleOptions is called, which calls CommandUtils.parseOrLoadMessage.
This wraps your message as { payload: { theSettingProperty: ... } }.

AppManager:
AppManager.start(message) is called with the message object.
The message is merged with app context, then passed to each transmission’s process(message).

Transmission:
The transmission’s process(message) method is called, which passes the message to each processor in the pipeline.

Processor (TestSetting):
The processor’s process(message) is called.
In TestSetting.js, it calls this.getProperty(ns.trn.theSettingProperty).

ProcessorImpl.getProperty:

Checks if the property is in the message (via propertyInMessage).
If not, checks settings/config.
