A fundamental principle I'm *attempting* to apply to my current code is that interdependencies should be low. Things should be tied together only as needed, declaratively.

One practical downside, of this, down to how I've got my dev environment set up, is that when something isn't working, rather than an integrated lump needing debugging, typically two things and their connection need checking. Independent places. Right now for me that means separate tools.

A paradoxical downside during this way suboptimal phase, whenever the coupling is too tight the problems it causes are amplified. Side effects spread.
