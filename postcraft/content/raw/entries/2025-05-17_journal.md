### [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/)

This thing is very nice. It uses Devin AI to analyze a given GitHub repo and generate docs. Right now it's free to use, so I've already slapped a button on several of my repos. The docs are quite comprehensive, but it's worth noting that they focus on the nuts & bolts. So for example the [DeepWiki for Transmissions](https://deepwiki.com/danja/transmissions) dives straight into *Architecture Overview*, from a **Transmissions Developer**'s point of view. But it's a mini-framework, the docs should start from the pov of **Transmissions User**. The whole point is that most of the nuts & bolts are hidden.

You can apparently also ask Devin about the repo via an LLM chat interface, but so far, for me it seems to time out.
