## Idea Generation from Imagined Acronym Expansions

Claude is funny. I'm putting together a knowledgebase navigation system based on an ontology, [ZPT](https://github.com/danja/zpt) for use in [Semem](https://github.com/danja/semem) (not *semen*).
I've go the under-the-hood pieces mostly in place, right now Claude & I are looking at [Model Control Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (not *male chauvinist pig*) access.

ZPT is **Zoom, Pan, Tilt**, using a camera metaphor for looking at knowledge. Claude doesn't like that acronym expansion. When I've had it write docs it prefers **"Zero-point traversal"** which sounds like a thing, maybe from around graph theory, or *quantum*, but as far as I can tell, *isn't*. Just now Claude gave me another : **"Zero-Prompt Templates"**. Again it sounds like a thing, like *zero-shot prompting* is, but, nah. Claude made it up.

Now I must to know what these things are.
