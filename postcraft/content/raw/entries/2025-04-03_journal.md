My scrappy coding around `src/engine` in #:transmissions has come back to bite me on the bum.

After the earliest hacky versions, I did start separating out `src/model` modules to (primarily) represent the state, `src/engine` for the operations. But because the system was working I got distracted...


```sh
./trans -v accumulate -m '{"foreach": ["first TEST_PASSED", "second TEST_PASSED", "third TEST_PASSED"]}'
```
