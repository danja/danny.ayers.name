## Inversion of control

For a change this afternoon the **AI has given me directions**.

My priority at the moment is getting #:semem organized, but to that end I need some extras in #:transmissions, and better SPARQL UI... So I've been on a little cycle round the subprojects. Which today has led me to #:tbox, which is just a Docker setup with containers that will hopefully, eventually, run the projects in a unified, consistent, portable fashion.

I'm not very good with Docker, hate this kind of admin. After a bit of discussion with Claude I decided I need CI/CD on my thing. GitHub workflows are relatively new to me - and it's more of the same kind of admin. So I asked Claude how I should tidy up #:tbox and also how to do testing/CI. Two artifacts, 3 pages each, which I've printed. This afternoon I'll just work through them. At least until I get distracted by the need to do one of the real-world chores I've been procrastinating over. Faced with a more boring task, cleaning the kitchen seems a lot more manageable.

PS. I started following Claude's instructions, but only got so far because one of the services I want #:tbox running, Prosody XMPP, isn't working. A problem I was aware of, but I'd thought it better to get the tests in place first.

So now I'm in the process of fixing that breakage using GPT-4.1 in Windsurf. In other words, **I'm delegating...**

Progress! (As a Dickensian mill boss might say).

Funnily enough, the code the junior agent is now working on is from #:tia, which I'm aiming to use as an ecosystem in which to create agents. ([dogbot]())

I predict a riot!
