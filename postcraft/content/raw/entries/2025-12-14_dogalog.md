# Dogalog

An educational toy - learn [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) while making beats! [Live on the Web](https://danja.github.io/dogalog/)! ([source](https://github.com/danja/dogalog))

I stumbled on [Euclidean Rhythms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_rhythm) a little while ago, an arithmetic pattern for spacing beats in a bar, found across all kinds of music. It's kinda like a constraint problem.

More recently I had another look at [livecoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) music. I seem to have something of a mental block on it, I still haven't really had a go. Although intrigued I did write a [MCP server](https://github.com/danja/sp-mc) for [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/).

Anyway, the other night I couldn't sleep. Those ideas clunked together in my head, making me think about livecoding in Prolog. I spent most of the night roughing something out with Codex. I still haven't looked if there's already a Prolog livecoding engine - I'm probably reinventing the wheel. Well, this will be training wheels.

Because the following day I realised I couldn't remember how Prolog works. So the challenge became to make something that would get me livecoding *and* teach me Prolog.
[Dogalog](https://danja.github.io/dogalog/) is the result of a good few hours with Claude on it. It's reasonably well structured, should be ok to extend/maintain. Probably a mistake implementing the Prolog engine from scratch. But without the fancier constructs and optimisations, it isn't that complicated: term definitions, parser, unifier. The in-place editing went a lot more smoothly than I could have imagined.

It would benefit from a few more eyeballs. I wonder if anyone still teaches Prolog?
I guess I'll post to Reddit, [r/livecoding](https://www.reddit.com/r/livecoding/) and [r/prolog](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolog/).
