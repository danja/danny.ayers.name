## New Domain : tensegrity.it

I've added a new DNS domain to my collection, so I now have :

1. [danny.ayers.name](https://danny.ayers.name) - my personal site (this blog)
2. [hyperdata.it](https://hyperdata.it) - my quasi-company site
3. [strandz.it](https://strandz.it) - for a project, in planning
4. [tensegrity.it](https://tensegrity.it) - my current raft of code projects

They are all undeniably **Under Construction**.

The new one came about because I realised that my the things I'm working on strongly resemble a [tensegrity structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity). Only after setting up a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/danja/tensegrity) to record this did I think to check for the domain name. Right now the repo just contains a sketchy overview. I'll use the new domain for now just as a tech blog, keeping the `.name` domain for non-coding stuff.
