‚óè To join the "shed" chat room from your local XMPP client, you'll need to use the following details:

  1. Room Address: shed@conference.xmpp
  2. Server Address: Use your localhost or the IP where Docker is running
  3. Port: 5222 (standard XMPP port)

  Here are the detailed steps for popular XMPP clients:

  Using Pidgin/Adium/Gajim:

  1. Configure your XMPP account (if you haven't already):
    - Username: Create any username (e.g., "user")
    - Domain: xmpp or localhost
    - Password: Set any password
    - Server: localhost (or your Docker host IP)
    - Port: 5222
    - Security: Check "Allow plain text authentication" and "Allow invalid/self-signed certificates"
  2. Join the MUC (Multi-User Chat) room:
    - Room: shed
    - Server: conference.xmpp
    - Nickname: Choose any name

  Using a Command Line Client like Profanity:

  /connect localhost 5222 username password
  /join shed@conference.xmpp

  For most XMPP clients:

  Use the room JID: shed@conference.xmpp
  Server: localhost:5222
