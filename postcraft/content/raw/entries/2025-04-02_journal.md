When I run a transmission and wish to examine the state of a Processor, eg. in `src/processors/flow/NOP.js` I call the `reveal(this)` function in  `src/utils/Logger.js`. But currently this is telling me :
```
TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON
    --> starting at object with constructor 'Transmission'
    |     property 'processors' -> object with constructor 'Object'
    |     property 'http://purl.org/stuff/transmissions/p10' -> object with constructor 'ShowMessage'
    --- property 'transmission' closes the circle
    at JSON.stringify (<anonymous>)
    at logger.reveal (file:///home/danny/hyperdata/transmissions/src/utils/Logger.js:172:24)
    at NOP.process (file:///home/danny/hyperdata/transmissions/src/processors/flow/NOP.js:15:8)
    at NOP.executeQueue (file:///home/danny/hyperdata/transmissions/src/model/Processor.js:153:24)
```
But I can't see where that circle is created in the code. Please find which lines where do that. Is there any reason to want the circular ref?  
```

I'm trying to get a node in a transmission to get its setting config values from the transmission (if they are there). I believe a  ref is being passed along, lines 58 and 113 in src/engine/TransmissionBuilder.js then from the `/home/danny/hyperdata/transmissions/src/model/Processor.js` to `src/engine/ProcessorSettings.js`. But when I run `src/applications/trial/transmissions.ttl` (with a call in `src/processors/flow/NOP.js`) it isn't picking up the value.
