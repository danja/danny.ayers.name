## Mayday!

Yesterday, indirectly prompted by something Inky danbri was working on, I wound up creating *yet another project*.

## [wstore](https://github.com/danja/wstore)  

A simple Node.js HTTP server and command-line client for file storage and retrieval.

Something I wanted for #:semem was an object store. Like a filesystem interface but with slightly more useful, webbier, addressing. I had looked into `minion`? something like that - a store you could run locally but has the same interface as something AWS. Too much overhead for my purposes. This made me realise what I wanted was *really dumb* object store. It should also be **webbier**. *D'oh!* **Just use HTTP** + filesystem. I'm working in node (ES modules), Express has this pretty much covered out of the box. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE plus HTTP Basic auth will do me. I set Claude at the task.
As a sanity check, and so I had a clue on how to interface with it programmatically, I also wanted a matching CLI client. Basically a simple `curl` in node.
