**Blog ~might be~ is back!**

Ok, that was arduous. I had to rewrite a big chunk of the core code for #:transmissions, my pipeliney thing. It'd simply got too spaghettified. But barring a handful of minor misalignment problems, it's working again. #:postcraft is the canonical app, this blog is published using it.

*Before going any further, I will declare that **I've been busy!**
A bunch of stuff I've been working on is approaching the point where it might be worth putting in front of other eyebrows, if not yet eyeballs. I'm planning to get *something* of each of the bits at least relatively stable & written up enough to look at by the summer solstice. To allow breathing space, I'll review for a bit, properly announce anything worthwhile on 2025-07-03.*

#:postcraft is possibly the world's most over-engineered Static Site Builder. After crawling dirs for markdown files it posts the material off to a SPARQL store. Then another pipeline is set up to query the store and render the site.

The over-engineering is intentional. The data in the SPARQL store is there for other uses. A couple of days ago I got #:semem, my Semantic Memory thing to create embeddings from the content and allow this to be used for 'semantic search'.

Btw, the #:semtags do have a purpose : **Semantic Hashtags**. I've a very short, simple spec written for them here somewhere - the `#:` marker says the string that follows has some kind of significance in the the current domain. In practice, they are a markdown extension that I intend to use here by replacing with a link to a query on a service - a search, but ultimately using #semem as the engine.

For a first pass I'm thinking of templating a query, something like :

```sparql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept>

SELECT ?resources WHERE {

    ?c a skos:Concept ;
       rdfs:label ?label ;
       rdfs:seeAlso ?resources .

   FILTER regex(?label, "^{{semtag}}", "i")
}
```

Elsewhere I'll put together some basic definitions.
