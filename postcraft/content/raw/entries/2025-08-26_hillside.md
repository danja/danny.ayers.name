# Hillside Media Visualizer

Yesterday/this morning I made a tune. This afternoon I made a visualization for it.

I named it after the first thing I saw when I looked out of the window : [Hillside](https://danja.github.io/hillside/) (live demo).

I've spent most of the last couple of weeks working on [Semem](https://github.com/danja/semem/) (I'm blogging that on [tensegrity.it](https://tensegrity.it/)). I had one of those phases where I seemed to be going around in circles - there was a disconnect in my integration somewhere. But I got past that, it was mostly down to a slip-up with namespaces. But I was spending more and more time in the music room.

I like to stick [music room things up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@djayers). Often impulsive, after a few beers. Recently a lot have been short things I've come up with playing with the modular synth. But spending more time in there got me more involved. The latest tune I've been playing with (it might not be finished) seemed to require more than *yet another bloke leaning over synth/computer* video.

I have looked around at music visualizers a bit recently. I used one for the track [Feral August](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPRFWLqUiGs) the other day. But it was a really long-winded workflow getting the video together. Would be quicker to have something running live...

Coincidentally someone linked to a CodePen [neat simulation of a solar flare](https://codepen.io/Power-Flower/pen/GgRowgg) on Reddit. Inplemented in a single HTML file. Cool, I'll have that.

With considerable help from Claude Code I flipped it into a [Vite](https://vite.dev/) project to make it easier to extend/reuse. Then added an audio player, hooked in a few of the algorithm parameters to it. Good fun.
