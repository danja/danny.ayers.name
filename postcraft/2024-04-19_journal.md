I need to create a new Processor for SPARQL literal escaping. Good opportunity to write doc - for agents of all kinds.

As I'm writing I realise I've long-overlooked a pattern that will be useful, would have been obvious in Java (which I spent a lot of time with, in a past life) : **Extract Interface**.

I want to hide the implementation of the enginey bits from subclasses of `Processor`, but expose them to the other engine bits. This will look weird, but I reckon I want `Processor` to be an interface, a subclass of `ProcessorImpl`.

Funny, pretty much first pass that worked... not. When I did the renaming, the (not great) refactoring bits built into VS Code did a thorough swap. Then I made a load of silly

I got some good docs writted, and also found some broken things I wasn't aware of...

The time it currently takes to render my blog, badly, is hilarious.
